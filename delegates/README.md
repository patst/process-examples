# Delegates

Show how the different delegate styles work.

Delegate styles:

* Java Class (Full qualified classname)
* Expression to do something directly
* Delegate Expression to point to a Java Delegate implementation
* External task for tasks which will be fulfilled by some external task implementation


## External task delegate

For the external task example a `@EnableScheduling` annotation is added to be able to use scheduled quartz jobs.
